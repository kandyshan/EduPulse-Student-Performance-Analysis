# EduPulse-Student-Performance-Analysis
EduPulse simulates a comprehensive education dataset to analyze academic performance trends across gender, parental background, region, and school types using Python, SQL Server, and Excel.  This project showcases real-world data engineering and exploratory data analysis workflows for educational insights.

## Objectives
* Understand school and student performance trends over time

* Analyze impact of parental education, household income, and COVID-19

* Apply SQL data modeling and Python-based data exploration

## Tools & Technologies
* Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SQLAlchemy)

* SQL Server 2025

* Excel / CSV

* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Data Simulation & Normalization using Python
2. SQL Data Modeling (Star Schema)
3. Data Import into SQL Server
4. Python-Database Integration (SQLAlchemy)
5. Data Cleaning & Transformation
6. Exploratory Data Analysis
7. Visualization & Insights
## Key Insights
Performance improved across all years post-COVID

Minimal correlation between household income and performance

Narrow gender gaps with competitive results across subjects

Parental education level had minor effect on student scores
